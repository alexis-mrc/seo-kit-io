# SEO Kit

## Introduction

**SEO Kit** is an Angular boilerplate designed to simplify the creation of a website optimized for search engine optimization (SEO) and performance, while also providing a structured guide for content, particularly **pillar content**. Intended for developers of all levels, SEO Kit handles the complex aspects of SEO, allowing you to focus on content creation and user experience.

## Why Use SEO Kit?

Being visible on Google is crucial for attracting a steady flow of new users without advertising costs. SEO Kit allows you to create an optimized website that maximizes your chances of appearing in the top search results by following best practices in technical performance and content structuring.

## Possible Use Cases with SEO Kit

SEO Kit can be used for two types of projects:
- **Main Site**: If your site is a showcase site, you can host it on the main domain.
- **Subdomain**: If your site's purpose is to redirect to a main web application, we recommend hosting the site generated by SEO Kit on the main domain, while the web application resides on a subdomain (e.g., `app.xxx.xx`).

## How to Use SEO Kit?

SEO Kit allows you to set up an SEO-optimized website in just a few hours by following the guide's instructions. This guide walks you through each step, from project initialization to online publication, while providing tips on structuring your content to maximize visibility.

## No Limitations

There are no limitations imposed by SEO Kit. The code is 100% editable thanks to a simple repository clone. You are free to customize every aspect of your project to perfectly match your needs.

## Maintenance and Evolution

To keep your project up to date, simply pull the latest changes from the main repository. This ensures that you always benefit from the latest optimizations and new features integrated into SEO Kit.

## Technical Optimizations

SEO Kit incorporates various technical optimizations to ensure your site is fast and well-ranked by Google:
- **Load Time Optimization**: SEO Kit uses techniques like lazy loading, preloading critical resources, and file minification to reduce load times.
- **Prerendering During Build (PPR)**: To improve indexing by search engines, SEO Kit generates files during the build process, ensuring that when a page loads, only the HTML page transfer time is required. This also enhances indexing by search engine crawlers.
- **Image Optimization**: SEO Kit includes tools to compress and resize images optimally, considering different formats and screen resolutions.
- **SEO Best Practices**: The boilerplate follows SEO best practices, such as proper use of HTML tags, header structuring, and the integration of optimized meta tags.

## Features

- **Angular 18**: Utilize the latest features of Angular for a robust frontend.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Style your application effortlessly with Tailwind's utility-first CSS framework.
- **Nx**: Leverage Nx for a monorepo setup, providing a scalable and maintainable structure.
- **Easy Deployment**: Deploy on Firebase with a one-click button or get your site files to deploy on any server.
