# Pages - Creating Child Pages

## Overview
Child pages are used to dive deeper into specific topics covered in a pillar page. They provide more detailed content on a sub-topic, which enhances the overall SEO of the pillar page and offers valuable information to users.

## Creating a Child Page

### Using Surfer for Content Creation
To create content for a child page, you can use Surfer to assist with keyword research and content writing. Identify a specific sub-topic from your pillar page that needs more detail. Use Surferâ€™s content editor to generate the markdown file for the child page. Upload this markdown via the web CLI to generate the base HTML for the page. Note that uploading this markdown will overwrite any existing HTML for that page.

### Manual Creation
Alternatively, you can manually create the HTML for the child page. This method provides more flexibility but requires more effort. Use SEO Kit components, such as image management, to ensure consistency in design and functionality. It is recommended to use Surfer or a similar tool like Frase.io for content generation.

## Linking Between Pages

### Adding Links
Ensure that there is at least one link from the pillar page to the child page and vice versa. The links should include anchor text relevant to the topic of the other page. For example, on the pillar page, include a link to the child page with anchor text like 'Sitemap' if the child page covers that topic. On the child page, include a link back to the pillar page with anchor text such as 'improve your technical SEO'.

## SEO Considerations
Focus on creating high-quality, detailed content for child pages. SEO Kit will handle the technical aspects of SEO, so your main concern should be providing valuable and relevant content. Use Surfer or Frase.io to assist with content creation and optimization.

## Visibility and Menu Configuration
Child pages should not be included in the main navigation. They are intended to support the pillar page by adding depth and semantic weight, rather than attracting direct traffic. This helps to improve the SEO of the pillar page without cluttering the main navigation.
