# Pages - Landing CRO

Landing pages optimized for Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO) are specifically designed to meet user expectations and drive actions, such as signing up, purchasing, or any other key conversions.

## Key Characteristics

- **Respond to User Expectations**: These pages are tailored to address the immediate needs and questions of the users, often using a strong catchphrase and key information delivered through SEO Kit components.

- **Visual Emphasis**: CRO pages are more visually driven with less content, focusing on delivering a clear and compelling message quickly. Due to the reduced content, they typically rank lower in search engines compared to more content-rich pages.

- **Primary URL Placement**: These pages are often located at the main URL (root) of the website, making them easily accessible to visitors.

- **Brand-Specific Search**: Users often find these pages by searching for the exact name of the brand, application, or website in their browsers.
