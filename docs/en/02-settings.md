## Website Information

- **Contact Email**: Provide the primary contact email for the website. (displayed in the footer by default)

## Favicon Information

- **Favicon URL**: Provide the URL for the favicon. The favicon should be added via the WebCLI's assets feature, which optimizes the image by compressing it and converting it to the WebP format.
- **Favicon Preview**: If the favicon exists in the `public` folder of the client app, it will be displayed here. The preview will also show the native width and height of the image.
- **Native Width x Height**: This displays the original dimensions of the favicon, which is useful for ensuring that the image maintains its aspect ratio.

## Logo Information

- **Logo URL**: Provide the URL for the logo. Like the favicon, the logo should be uploaded through the WebCLI's assets feature for optimization.
- **Logo Width (in px) x Height (in px)**: Specify the dimensions for the logo. Maintaining the correct aspect ratio is important for visual consistency.
- **Logo Preview**: If the logo exists in the `public` folder of the client app, it will be displayed here along with its native width and height. This helps ensure that the logo is displayed correctly in the application.
